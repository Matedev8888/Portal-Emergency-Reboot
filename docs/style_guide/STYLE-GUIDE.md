//STYLE GUIDE

==GRAY BOX==

Use this style before detaling for quciker compile

use dev/reflectivity_90 texture for everything

also use simple lighting if any

after the maps layout and puzzle is finnished convert the map to another style


==CLEAN==

Used in Chapter 1 of Portal Emengency Reboot

This is the 2nd simplest style, 

Unlike in Portal 2, as door model use models\props\portal_door_combined_new.mdl (included by deafult in P2:CE, (thx to November)) with 'skin' input to change the door color (look revo, lot of P2:CE Maps)

Also use the pbr texture replacments from ApertureVR addon for P2:CE (thx Rip Rip Rip, ApertureVR team)

Lighting: Neutral mainly but warm and cool are ok

==RECONSTRUCTING CLEAN==

Same as CLEAN but, but this style looks like it wasnt completed (building exument, tilted, and wrongly aligned panels) walkways, BTS openings (look BTS) BTS elements flood lights (instances\MateDEV\floodlight.vmf) etc.

DO NOT USE DIRTY TEXTURES INSTEAD USE OVERLAYS WITH CTAINS MARKINGS, ETC.

==OFFICE==
